# Coding-Quiz-Challenge

## Description

I built a coding quiz challenge using javascript to reinforce my learning on how WEB API's work and are used. I created a fun quiz where a user is given 60 seconds to answer 10 multiple choice questions. If an answer is wrong, 10 seconds are deducted. If the user is unable to finish the quiz in the specified time then the quiz ends automatically.

## Usage

The user clicks 'Start Quiz' where they will be redirected to the quiz after which the countdown timer starts.

After the quiz ends, the user is asked to input their initials after which their quiz score will be displayed.
